1. includes the *clean* version of the episodes
2. includes the segment names

Here's what we're looking at

It's crazy that a clean feed doesn't exist -- especially since it's pretty much for people with kids who are busy.

It automatically scrapes on Sundays at 6pm PST. I don't encourage anybody to use this, even if you find this.
