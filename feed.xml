      <description>Chen Almog-Goldstein tells the story of life as a hostage in Gaza.

Prologue
The 251 hostages taken by Hamas a year ago have become a divisive symbol in Israel. Host Ira Glass talks about the father of one hostage, and what happened to him at a protest last week when he called for a hostage deal. (6 minutes)

Part One: The Abduction
On this week’s show, we’re airing excerpts of interviews with former hostages produced by an Israeli podcast, Echad Bayom. In these interviews they describe, in a remarkably detailed and complicated way, what happened to them a year ago.

Part Two: Daily Life in Captivity
Chen’s story continues, with a description of what it was like to be hidden in a small apartment with her children and their captors. (6 minutes)

Part Three: The Guards
Chen talks about the complicated relationship between her family and the people holding them hostage. (6 minutes)

Part Four: News from Home
Chen describes hearing the Israeli news while in captivity, including one night when her own father was interviewed. (4 minutes)

Part Five: Moving Around
Chen talks about what it was like to walk around the streets of Gaza in disguise and their eventual release, 51 days after they were taken from their home. (13 minutes)</description>
